# Development Notes

- **Reference Material**: Use `~/Developer/dotfilesold` for inspiration and proven configurations
- **Symlinks**: Configurations will be symlinked to appropriate system locations

## Development Workflow
1. **Reference dotfilesold**: Look at existing configurations for proven patterns
2. **Modernize**: Update approaches, tools, and techniques for current best practices
3. **Test in Context**: Since we'll move to ~/.dotfiles, consider how configurations will work in final location
4. **Iterate**: Build incrementally, testing each component

## Task Management Approach
- **tasks.md is NOT linear**: Phases and tasks are flexible roadmaps, not strict sequential execution
- **Everything needs discussion**: No task should be implemented without prior discussion and agreement
- **Brainstorming tool**: Use tasks.md to capture ideas as they emerge, then discuss and prioritize
- **Iterative planning**: Reorganize, reprioritize, and adjust based on discoveries during implementation

## Key Migration Considerations
- **Zsh Configuration**: Antidote instead of zgen
- **Neovim**: Pure Lua, conditional loading for Cursor vs Terminal
- **Search Tools**: ripgrep instead of ag, migrate all references
- **macOS Focus**: All solutions optimized for macOS only
