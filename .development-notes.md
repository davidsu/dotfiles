# Development Notes

## Modularity & Structure
- **Lean Core**: Keep main configuration files (like `zshrc`) lean and focused on orchestration.
- **Modular Components**: Extract specific configurations into dedicated files (e.g., `aliases.zsh`, `options.zsh`, `keybindings.zsh`).
- **Dotfilesold Inspiration**: Follow the modular patterns established in the previous dotfiles repository.
- **External Reference**: The `dotfilesold` repository is located at `~/Developer/dotfilesold`. Agents should refer to this for legacy configurations, functions (like `reload`), and logic. Use absolute paths to read from it.

## Communication & Decisions
- **Always Consult**: Never implement significant configurations, aliases, or behavioral changes without first proposing and discussing them with the user.
- **Explicit Approval**: Wait for a "go ahead" or a direct command before applying changes that affect the environment's behavior or structure.

## Context for Agents
- To ensure all agents have full context of `dotfilesold`, the user should add it to the Cursor workspace via **File > Add Folder to Workspace...**.
- When referring to `dotfilesold` in prompts or thoughts, always use the absolute path `/Users/thistooshallpass/Developer/dotfilesold`.
