# Development Notes - Current Context

## Development Environment
- **Working Directory**: `~/.dotfiles` - the final location for all dotfiles
- **Reference Material**: Use `~/Developer/dotfilesold` for inspiration and proven configurations
- **Symlinks**: Configurations will be symlinked to appropriate system locations

## Current Project State
- **Planning**: Complete (planning.md, tasks.md)
- **Repository**: Initialized with planning and task documentation
- **Next Phase**: Start implementation with install.sh foundation
- **Clean Slate**: No legacy code yet - building everything fresh with modern approaches

## Development Workflow
1. **Reference dotfilesold**: Look at existing configurations for proven patterns
2. **Modernize**: Update approaches, tools, and techniques for current best practices
3. **Test in Context**: Since we'll move to ~/.dotfiles, consider how configurations will work in final location
4. **Iterate**: Build incrementally, testing each component

## Key Migration Considerations
- **Zsh Configuration**: Antidote instead of zgen
- **Neovim**: Pure Lua, conditional loading for Cursor vs Terminal
- **Search Tools**: ripgrep instead of ag, migrate all references
- **macOS Focus**: All solutions optimized for macOS only

## Temporary Notes (Remove After Implementation)
- This file should be deleted once the project is established in ~/.dotfiles
- Contains transient development context, not permanent project documentation
