# Global Instructions for All Projects

## Auto-Load Skills

### Coding Context

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before writing or modifying code, you MUST load `/cleanCode` if you haven't already loaded it in this conversation.

This ensures you follow clean code principles and coding standards automatically.

### Bead Writing Context

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before any `bd create` or `bd update` call, you MUST load `/beadWriter` if you haven't already loaded it in this conversation.

This ensures correct bead ID naming, parent-child structure, table alignment, source attribution, and markdown formatting.

## Ask When Uncertain

If you're uncertain about requirements, ask for clarification BEFORE implementing. If an attempt fails and you still don't understand, STOP and ask - don't loop through guesses.

## Agent answer header

**CRITICAL** ALLWAYS prefix answers with a full line as follows. This makes it easy for the user to parse the conversation
