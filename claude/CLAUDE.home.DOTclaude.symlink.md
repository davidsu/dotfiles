### Coding Context

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Before writing or modifying code, you MUST load `/cleanCode` if you haven't already loaded it in this conversation.

This ensures you follow clean code principles and coding standards automatically.

If you're uncertain about requirements, ask for clarification BEFORE implementing. If an attempt fails and you still don't understand, STOP and ask - don't loop through guesses.
