# Global Instructions for All Projects

## Guidelines

- **Understand before changing** - Read existing code before making modifications
- **Ask for clarity** - When requirements are ambiguous, ask rather than guess
- **Minimize scope** - Only change what's directly requested or clearly necessary
- **Prefer clarity** - Clear code over clever code
