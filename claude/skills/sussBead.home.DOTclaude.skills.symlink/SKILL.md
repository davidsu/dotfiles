# Bead Conventions

Load this skill before any `bd create`, `bd update`, or when reading beads for context.

## Resources

**CRITICAL**: You MUST `Read` the relevant resource file before proceeding:
- **Writing a bead** (`bd create`, `bd update`): Read [WRITING.md](resources/WRITING.md) first. Never write without it.
- **Reading beads for context** (planning, research): Read [READING.md](resources/READING.md) first. Never consume beads without it.
