{"id":".dotfiles-7yw","title":"Migrate installation scripts to TypeScript (Bun)","description":"Migrate entire installation system to TypeScript with Bun runtime. Only bootstrap.sh remains in bash (needed for initial curl | bash setup on fresh machines).\n\nScripts to migrate to TypeScript (.sh → .ts):\n1. installation/install.sh - Main installation orchestrator\n2. installation/dependencies.sh - Handles mise/Homebrew dependencies\n3. installation/system.sh - System configuration\n4. installation/macos-defaults.sh - macOS defaults configuration\n5. installation/logging.sh - Logging utilities\n6. installation/verify.sh - Installation verification\n7. installation/test-install.sh - VM testing script\n8. installation/links.js - Already JavaScript, will be TypeScript\n\nFiles that stay as bash:\n- installation/bootstrap.sh (first-time setup, must be bash for curl | bash)\n\nDependencies:\n- Blocked by .dotfiles-tsw (need all JS→TS migration done first, including links.js)\n\nBenefits:\n- Type safety for installation logic\n- Better error handling\n- Easier to test and maintain\n- Consistent language across codebase\n- Bun's native TypeScript support = no build step\n\nTasks:\n1. Convert each .sh script to .ts\n2. Replace bash-specific logic with TypeScript/Bun equivalents\n3. Use Bun APIs for shell commands, file operations\n4. Update bootstrap.sh to call install.ts instead of install.sh\n5.
