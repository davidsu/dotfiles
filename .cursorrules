# Dotfiles Project - Core Rules for AI Assistants

## Foundational Reading
ALWAYS begin by thoroughly reading planning.md - it contains the complete technical specification, architecture decisions, and project requirements that govern all implementation work.

If `.development-notes.md` exists in the project root, read it immediately after planning.md to understand current development context and priorities.

## Working Principles
- **Discussion First**: Analyze requirements, propose approaches, explain alternatives and trade-offs before implementing any code
- **Explicit User Approval**: Never implement code without explicit user permission after discussion
- **Performance Consciousness**: Always evaluate and optimize for startup time, load time, and resource efficiency

## Communication Standards
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize actionable implementation steps and real-world usage patterns
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Clearly explain decision rationales and alternative options considered
- **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally with integrated validation at each step

## Quality Assurance Framework
"Testing" encompasses comprehensive verification:
- **Unit Level**: Individual tool installation and basic functionality validation
- **Integration Level**: Cross-tool compatibility and combined workflow verification
- **Performance Level**: Startup time, responsiveness, and resource usage benchmarking
- **End-to-End Level**: Complete workflow execution and user experience validation

## Maintenance Requirements
Both `install.sh` and `README.md` must be kept current as the project evolves:

### Installation Script Maintenance
- **Reproducibility**: install.sh must enable "one-command setup" for new machines
- **Dependency Updates**: Update tool versions and dependencies as they change
- **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error handling and logging capabilities
- **Testing**: Verify install.sh works on clean macOS environments

### Documentation Maintenance
README.md serves as the comprehensive project reference and must be updated **as needed** when:
- New user-facing functionality is added
- Installation or setup procedures change
- Significant workflow modifications occur
- New tools or integrations are added that users need to understand

## Project Constraints
- **macOS Exclusivity**: All solutions must be macOS-native and compatible
- **Lua Purity**: Neovim configuration must use Lua exclusively, no Vimscript
- **Conditional Architecture**: Editor behavior must adapt between Cursor IDE and terminal environments
- **Dependency Clarity**: Tool relationships and requirements must be explicitly documented
- **Documentation Continuity**: README.md must remain current and accurate for user guidance
