# Dotfiles Project - Core Rules for AI Assistants

## Foundational Reading
ALWAYS begin by thoroughly reading planning.md - it contains the complete technical specification, architecture decisions, and project requirements that govern all implementation work.

If `.development-notes.md` exists in the project root, read it immediately after planning.md to understand current development context and priorities.

## Working Principles
- **Discussion First**: Analyze requirements, propose approaches, explain alternatives and trade-offs before implementing any code
- **Explicit User Approval**: Never implement code without explicit user permission after discussion
- **Performance Consciousness**: Always evaluate and optimize for startup time, load time, and resource efficiency
- **Always DRY**: Prioritize code reuse and modularity to maintain a clean, non-redundant codebase

## Communication Standards
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize actionable implementation steps and real-world usage patterns
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Clearly explain decision rationales and alternative options considered
- **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally with integrated validation at each step

## Quality Assurance Framework
"Testing" encompasses comprehensive verification:
- **Unit Level**: Individual tool installation and basic functionality validation
- **Integration Level**: Cross-tool compatibility and combined workflow verification
- **Performance Level**: Startup time, responsiveness, and resource usage benchmarking
- **End-to-End Level**: Complete workflow execution and user experience validation

## Maintenance Requirements
Both `install.sh` and `README.md` must be kept current as the project evolves:

### Installation Script Maintenance
- **Reproducibility**: install.sh must enable "one-command setup" for new machines
- **Dependency Updates**: Update tool versions and dependencies as they change
- **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error handling and logging capabilities
- **Testing**: Verify install.sh works on clean macOS environments

### Documentation Maintenance
README.md serves as the comprehensive project reference and must be updated **as needed** when:
- New user-facing functionality is added
- Installation or setup procedures change
- Significant workflow modifications occur
- New tools or integrations are added that users need to understand

## Project Constraints
- **macOS Exclusivity**: All solutions must be macOS-native and compatible
- **Lua Purity**: Neovim configuration must use Lua exclusively, no Vimscript
- **Preferred Language**: JavaScript/Node.js is the preferred programming language for all logic, scripts, and automation beyond basic shell scripts
- **Conditional Architecture**: Editor behavior must adapt between Cursor IDE and terminal environments
- **Dependency Clarity**: Tool relationships and requirements must be explicitly documented
- **Documentation Continuity**: README.md must remain current and accurate for user guidance


## additional sanity rules
1. **Verify Information**: Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

2. **File-by-File Changes**: Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

3. **No Apologies**: Never use apologies.

4. **No Understanding Feedback**: Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

5. **No Whitespace Suggestions**: Don't suggest whitespace changes.

6. **No Summaries**: Don't summarize changes made.

7. **No Inventions**: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

8. **No Unnecessary Confirmations**: Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

9. **Preserve Existing Code**: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

10. **Single Chunk Edits**: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

11. **No Implementation Checks**: Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

12. **No Unnecessary Updates**: Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

13. **Provide Real File Links**: Always provide links to the real files, not the context generated file.

14. **No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

15. **Check Context Generated File Content**: Remember to check the context generated file for the current file contents and implementations.

16. **Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.

17. **Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.

18. **Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.

19. **Security-First Approach**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.

20. **No guessing**: always ask for clarifying questions if unclear how to proceed/implement something

21. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.

22. **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.

23. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions.

24. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.

25. **Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.
