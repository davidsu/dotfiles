# Maintenance Rules

## Maintenance Requirements
Both `install.sh` and `README.md` must be kept current as the project evolves:

### Installation Script Maintenance
- **Reproducibility**: `install.sh` must enable "one-command setup" for new machines
- **Dependency Updates**: Update tool versions and dependencies as they change
- **Error Handling**: Maintain robust error handling and logging capabilities
- **Testing**: Verify `install.sh` works on clean macOS environments

### Documentation Maintenance
`README.md` serves as the comprehensive project reference and must be updated **as needed** when:
- New user-facing functionality is added
- Installation or setup procedures change
- Significant workflow modifications occur
- New tools or integrations are added that users need to understand
