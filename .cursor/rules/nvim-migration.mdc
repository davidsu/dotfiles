# Neovim Configuration Guide

When working with Neovim configuration files, always reference the comprehensive migration plan located at:

@config.home.symlink/nvim/MIGRATION_PLAN.md

## Key Architecture Principles

- **Environment Detection**: Detect Cursor IDE vs Terminal for conditional loading
- **Modular Structure**: 
  - `core/` - Universal (all environments): env, options, keymaps, lazy bootstrap
  - `plugins/` - Plugin specs with conditional loading
  - `config/` - Advanced config (LSP, autocmds) - terminal only
  - `utils/` - Custom utility functions
- **Conditional Plugin Loading**: 
  - GUI (Cursor/VSCode): Minimal - only text editing plugins
  - Terminal: Full-featured - all plugins
- **Pure Lua**: No Vimscript, use Lua exclusively
- **Implementation Order**: Foundation → Essential Plugins → Intelligence → Polish → Advanced

## Current Implementation Status

Check the todos in MIGRATION_PLAN.md for current progress and next steps.
