# Tech Stack Rules

## Project Constraints
- **macOS Exclusivity**: All solutions must be macOS-native and compatible
- **Lua Purity**: Neovim configuration must use Lua exclusively, no Vimscript
- **Preferred Language**: JavaScript/Node.js is the preferred programming language for all logic, scripts, and automation beyond basic shell scripts
- **Conditional Architecture**: Editor behavior must adapt between Cursor IDE and terminal environments
- **Dependency Clarity**: Tool relationships and requirements must be explicitly documented
- **Documentation Continuity**: `README.md` must remain current and accurate for user guidance
